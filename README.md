# Middleman-Webpack
A minimal Middleman 4 template using webpack 5 and the Yarn package manager.
It comes with floating-ui, a minimal popup placement library.

This may be maintained sporadically or not at all as things change, and is a result of me trying to figure things out for myself.

## Installation
Initialize your Middleman project using the template option:
```bash
middleman init your-project -T camplowell/middleman-webpack
```
Then install the yarn dependencies:
```bash
yarn install
```
