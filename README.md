# Middleman-Webpack
A minimal Middleman 4 template using webpack 5 and the Yarn package manager.
It comes with Bootstrap 5 and JQuery 3.7 preinstalled.

This may be maintained sporadically or not at all as things change, and is a result of me trying to figure things out for myself.

## Installation
Initialize your Middleman project using the template option:
```bash
middleman your-project init -T camplowell/middleman-webpack
```
